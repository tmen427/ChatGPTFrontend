          The United States Capital
  
  Mr. Speaker. Madam Vice President. Our First Lady and Second Gentleman.
  
  Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Leaders of our military.
  
  Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, and retired Justices of the Supreme Court.
  
  And you, my fellow Americans.
  
  I start tonight by congratulating the members of the 118th Congress and the new Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy.
  
  Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working together.
  
  I also want to congratulate the new leader of the House Democrats and the first Black House Minority Leader in history, Hakeem Jeffries.
  
  Congratulations to the longest serving Senate Leader in history, Mitch McConnell.
  
  And congratulations to Chuck Schumer for another term as Senate Majority Leader, this time with an even bigger majority.
  
  And I want to give special recognition to someone who I think will be considered the greatest Speaker in the history of this country, Nancy Pelosi.
  
  The story of America is a story of progress and resilience. Of always moving forward. Of never giving up.
  
  A story that is unique among all nations.
  
  We are the only country that has emerged from every crisis stronger than when we entered it.
  
  That is what we are doing again.
  
  Two years ago, our economy was reeling.
  
  As I stand here tonight, we have created a record 12 million new jobs, more jobs created in two years than any president has ever created in four years.
  
  Two years ago, COVID had shut down our businesses, closed our schools, and robbed us of so much.
  
  Today, COVID no longer controls our lives.
  
  And two years ago, our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War.
